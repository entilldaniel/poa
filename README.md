# Ports and adapters

This is a very simple project showing the advantages with using a ports and adapters pattern.
See the README in each initial project to see how to run each application.

## Why do I do this project?

This project is to show that with the help of the ports and adapters pattern we can separate 
the core business logic from the application. 
Some would argue that with this we can change how we provide this service, this is however not my main 
argument for this pattern.  
Rather I would argue that this makes the for a clear separation of concerns, we have the logic and we have what 
drives the application (input) and what the application drives (output) separated with clear boundaries.
